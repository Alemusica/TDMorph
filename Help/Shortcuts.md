# Shortcuts

There are various shortcuts in the TDMorph ecosystem. I have tried to keep them as simple as possible, so the only keys you will ever have to remember are `shift`, `control` and some `mouse button`.

## ElementsContainer

### When pressing over a preset slot

* shift + left click = store a preset
* shift + right click = delete a preset
* shift + middle click = freeze a preset
* ctrl + left click = jump to preset (no interpolation)
* ctrl + righ click = morph to preset in 1 second (meant for quick transition check)

### When pressing over an element's name 

* shift + left click = set the element to value found on creation
* shift + right click = change element's name

### When pressing over an container's name 

* shift + right click = change element's name

### When pressing on an element's container empty space

* right click = reveal menu with various actions to take

## ScenesLauncher

### When pressing on a Scenes Launhcer empty space

* right click = reveal menu with various actions to take

## MIDI and OSC

### When either is enabled

* left click = activate auto-learning (expects a MIDI or OSC change to map it)
* right click = sets the parameter to the learned MIDI or OSC signal
* middle click = deletes the MIDI or OSC mapping
