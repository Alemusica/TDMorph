# TDMorph

TDMorph is a toolbox for enhanced parametric exploration in the TouchDesigner platform. It is meant to help in creating generative content via various methods and sharing of interesting parameter configurations among users.  

## How does it work?

There are two main approaches you may take

1) You can create a UI from where to control your parameters, using sliders and a set of buttons that perform various functions.
2) You can create a UI-less parameters and presets manager, which does everything the UI does, but via scripting and with a different paradigm.
