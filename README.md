# TDMorph

TDMorph is a toolbox for enhanced parametric exploration in the TouchDesigner platform. It is meant to help in creating generative content via various methods and sharing of interesting parameter configurations among users using a JSON format.

## What can I do with it?

1) Random search of states for parameters on any node using various different distributions.
2) Random morphing between states using various different interpolation curves.
3) Storing and retrieval of any arbitrary number of presets.
4) Control of parameters with an automatically generated UI.
5) Automatic storing, randomization and transformation of all parameters of arbitrary nodes.
6) Auto-learn MIDI and OSC for every control in the generated UI.
7) Fulls scripting control of all features via high-level commands.
8) Global and local controls for every single parameter.

## How does it work?

There are two main approaches you may take:

+ You can create a UI from where to control your parameters, using sliders and a set of buttons that perform various functions.
+ You can create a Preset Manager node, which does everything the UI does but with a slightly different paradigm.

## Ok, I want to use it!

Great! Please check the following tutorials to learn all the features in a structured manner:

## Nah, I just want to code! 

Fair enough, here documentation of all relevant methods:

```python
print(x) 
```
